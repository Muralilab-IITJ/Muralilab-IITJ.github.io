      "abstract": "Midfrontal theta increases during scenarios when conflicts are successfully resolved. Often considered a generic signal of cognitive control, its temporal nature has hardly been investigated. Using advanced spatiotemporal techniques, we uncover that midfrontal theta occurs as a transient oscillation or 'event' at single trials with their timing reflecting computationally distinct modes.",
